# Voice-Enabled LLM Agentic Construction Scheduler


This project presents an LLM-based agentic system for automating construction scheduling using voice input. The user describes the construction project through audio, and the system converts the speech into text and understands the project requirements using a Large Language Model. Based on this understanding, the system automatically creates a construction schedule. The aim is to make project planning easier, faster, and more user-friendly by allowing natural voice-based interaction.
